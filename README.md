# Scraper for get my next graphic card

Yeah, I know, I'm a nerd. I'm a nerd that want to get a new graphic card, but I don't want to pay the price that the market is asking for. So I decided to make a scrapper to get the price of the graphic card that I want.

P.S: That comment was made by Copilot, don't blame me.
